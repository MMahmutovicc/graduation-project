## About The Project

This project is my high school graduation project, and its main topic is "Interactive Material for Learning the C++ Programming Language". I wanted to showcase my abilities at that time, so the entire implementation of the project was done solely by me. I even wrote my own CSS for everything in the project, avoiding frameworks like Bootstrap. I collected material and created lectures and videos for each lecture.

The complete documentation of the project is located in the "Documentation" folder.

The framework used is Laravel.
